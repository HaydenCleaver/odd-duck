This website pushes the user through a voting system to determine their favorite products by clicking the pictures that pop up.  Once they've completed this, statistcs showing the amount of views and clicks for each picture will be rendered.

### Lab 11

Got the core site running with rendering clickable images and tallying up the views/clicks which are shown with a results button.

### Lab 12 Additions

Added a couple of CSS elements and more will probably be worked on after I submit.  Added a visual representation of data with a bar graph.  Pictures also won't be shown for at least one round after appearing as a selection option.

## Reflections and Comments

**Lab 12**: Had a lot of issues trying to implement my idea for ensuring pictures don't repeat in a subsequent round.  I ended up talking a TA (thanks Ben!) that had a completely different approach to the idea, but after he explained the logic it was actually pretty easy to implement the code.
